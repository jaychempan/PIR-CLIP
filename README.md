## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction
This paper presents a prior instruction representation (PIR) learning paradigm that draws on prior knowledge to instruct adaptive learning of vision and text representations. Firstly, a prior instruction remote sensing image-text retrieval framework (PIR-ITR) , aimed at remote sensing vision-language understanding tasks to solve the semantic noise problem. Concretely, two progressive attention encoder (PAE) structures, Spatial-PAE and Temporal-PAE, are proposed to perform long-range dependency modeling to enhance key feature representation. In vision representation, Vision Instruction Representation (VIR) based on Spatial-PAE exploits the prior-guided knowledge of the remote sensing scene recognition by building a belief matrix to select key features for reducing the impact of semantic noise. In text representation, Language Cycle Attention (LCA) based on Temporal-PAE uses the previous time step to cyclically activate the current time step to enhance text representation capability. A cluster-wise affiliation loss is proposed to constrain the inter-classes and to reduce the semantic confusion zones in the common subspace. Based on PIR, we propose PIR-CLIP, a domain-specific CLIP-based framework for RSITR, to fill in the gaps of comparisons with open-domain retrieval methods on the remote sensing domain Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that using prior knowledge instruction could enhance vision and text representations and could outperform the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, RSICD and RSITMD.

## üéØ Implementation
### Environments
base on `open_clip` environments, you can click here [open_clip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip).

### Train
If using Affiliation loss, add `is_aff_loss` where the label information is obtained by `image_name` from datasets. For example, we can train PIR-CLIP using the follow commad:
```
python -m training.main \
    --save-frequency 1 \
    --report-to tensorboard \
    --train-data="path/to/webdataset/tar" \
    --dataset-resampled \
    --train-num-samples num_dataset \
    --dataset-type webdataset \
    --warmup 10000 \
    --batch-size=512\
    --precision amp \
    --lr=1e-5 \
    --wd=0.5 \
    --epochs=20 \
    --workers=4 \
    --model=PIR \
    --is_aff_loss
```
or parallel training as
```
torchrun --nproc_per_node 2 \
    --rdzv_endpoint=$HOSTE_NODE_ADDR \
    -m training.main \
    --save-frequency 1 \
    ...
```
### Retrieval
Retrieval evaluation on [CLIP Benchmark](https://github.com/ChenDelong1999/RemoteCLIP) and checkpoints can download from here: [Baidu Disk]().
```
python retrieval.py \
    --model-name "PIR" \
    --retrieval-images-dir "path/to/images" \
    --retrieval-json-dir "path/to/dataset.json" \
    --remoteclip-path "./checkpoints/PIR-CLIP_RSITMD.pt"
```
## üåé Datasets

All experiments are based on [RSITMD](https://github.com/xiaoyuan1996/AMFMN/tree/master/RSITMD), [RSICD](https://github.com/201528014227051/RSICD_optimal) datasets and pre-training dataset [RS5M](https://github.com/om-ai-lab/RS5M).
